# Development Guidelines

## Scenes

Each developer has a scene with their usc email id as the name of the scene. Please do all your testing / feature work on this scene and please **do not interfere with the Master** scene. The person doing the integrations will be responsible for collecting all the necessary working bits from each scene and merging onto the Master. This way we can keep a consistent, compilable and working build at the end of each week.
