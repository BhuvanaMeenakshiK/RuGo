# Development Guidelines

## Scenes

Each developer has a scene with their usc email id as the name of the scene. Please do all your testing / feature work on this scene and please **do not interfere with the Master** scene. The person doing the integrations will be responsible for collecting all the necessary working bits from each scene and merging onto the Master. This way we can keep a consistent, compilable and working build at the end of each week.

## Scripts

Each developer also should **create a folder inside the global Scripts folder** with their usc email id as the name of their scripts folder. Please insert all your scripts here and work locally on them as much as possible. If there is a need to reuse a script and you feel like you need to edit that script, make sure you communicate that need with the author of that script. This way we can avoid a lot of unnecessary merge conflict issues.

Every week when the integrations are performed, the necessary scripts will be brought into a **Master folder inside the Scripts folder**. This again will help us keep a compilable and working build at the end of each week.

## Prefabs

Similar to Scripts, before creating your prefab ensure that you create a folder with your usc email id as the name of the folder inside the **global Prefabs folder**. Drag and drop your prefabs into this folder and try to keep it as localized as possible. If a change is need in the prefab, please let the author know that you will be making changes to the respective prefab.

Every week when the integrations are performed, the necessary prefabs will be brought into a **Master folder inside the Prefabs folder**. All references will be carefully looked at to make sure there are no broken references. This again will help us keep a compilable and working build at the end of each week.

## Materials and Textures

Everytime you create a new material for your scene, please place the material in the **Materials** folder. Please be thoughtful when it comes to naming your materials so that it can be reused by others when building their prototypes. 

We will follow the same principle for **Textures** folder as well. Good descriptive names go a long way into helping others search for the material and/or textures they want to use with their prototypes.
