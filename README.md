# Development Guidelines

## Scenes

Each developer has a scene with their usc email id as the name of the scene. Please do all your testing / feature work on this scene and please **do not interfere with the Master** scene. The person doing the integrations will be responsible for collecting all the necessary working bits from each scene and merging onto the Master. This way we can keep a consistent, compilable and working build at the end of each week.

## Scripts

Each developer also should create a folder inside the global Scripts folder with their usc email id as the name of their scripts folder. Please insert all your scripts here and work locally on them as much as possible. If there is a need to reuse a script and you feel like you need to edit that script, make sure you communicate that need with the author of that script. This way we can avoid a lot of unnecessary merge conflict issues.

As with the scenes, every week when the integrations are performed, the necessary scripts will be brought into a **Master folder inside the Scripts folder**. This again will help us keep a compilable and working build at the end of each week.
